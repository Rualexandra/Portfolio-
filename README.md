# Portfolio-

This is my official Portfolio! As a first time developer I will be showing off my new learned skills and will be updating this as I continue to learn and create. Follow me on my journey!

# User Story

- AS A future Programmer, I WANT to view a deployed portfolio of work samples to show potential employers
- SO THAT I can show samples of my work and they can assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position

# Acceptance Criteria

- It's done WHEN I load my portfolio
- THEN I present my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me
- It's done WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- It's done WHEN I click on the link to the section about my work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications
- It's done WHEN I present the employers with the my first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- It's done WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- It's done WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
